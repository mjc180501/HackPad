### Challenges
I had never made a PCB before. I struggled to route it correctly because I initially did not know to route on both sides, so I was frustrated when I couldn't route the whole thing on the same side. 

### Inspiration
I used Hack Club's design as a baseline but added an additional key and connected each of the 5 keys to a keyboard shortcut in order to speed up my workflow when coding. Thanks to the HackPad tutorial for being descriptive and clear.
